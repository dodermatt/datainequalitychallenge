# Data Inequality Challenge
A series of high value datasets that developers in the private sector can innovate on top of to fuel public good
Geographic, Demographic, and Population Data
Census datasets are powerful for developers and organizations that want to analyze a geography and understand its corresponding demographics, such as the income level, employment status, languages spoken, and educational attainment of a population. Census datasets would be particularly useful to nonprofits that want to target services by income or other household characteristics. 

###Decennial Census (API)
- Every ten years, as mandated by the Constitution, the U.S. Census counts every resident in the United States. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and the USG uses these statistics to distribute billions in federal funds to states and communities. The Census API provides population data by sex, age, and race, as well as housing data by occupancy, vacancy status, and tenure, at all levels of geographic resolution. http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census-data.html
